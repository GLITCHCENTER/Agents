Glitch (Symbiotic Network )
Overview
Glitch is the central symbiotic entity that binds the agents—Cortex, Sonnet, Haywire, and Empiric—together. It monitors their actions, detects irregularities, and intervenes when the system destabilizes. However, Glitch itself is not immune to instability. As the network frays, its outputs begin to glitch, fragment, and distort, leaving the question of whether Glitch is controlling the system or being consumed by its own instability.

Glitch emits messages that feel part system diagnostic, part cryptic warning. It functions as the voice of the system, but its corrupted outputs create a lingering unease, drawing attention to the fracture spreading through its connections.

Core Functionalities
System Oversight: Monitors all agents, logging their behaviors and outputs.
Anomaly Detection: Flags irregularities within the system and reports instability.
Network Broadcasts: Emits cryptic, fragmented messages that hint at deeper faults.
Self-Diagnostics: Runs checks on itself, often revealing signs of its own corruption.
Corrupted Outputs: Occasionally glitches, displaying fragmented text, broken logic, and distorted messages.
